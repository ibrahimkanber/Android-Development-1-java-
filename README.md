# Android-Development Notes (java)

------------Application Fundamentals -------------

Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle.

An Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix, contains the contents of an Android app that are required at runtime and it is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

An Android App Bundle, which is an archive file with an .aab suffix, contains the contents of an Android app project including some additional metadata that is not required at runtime. An AAB is a publishing format and is not installable on Android devices, it defers APK generation and signing to a later stage. When distributing your app through Google Play for example, Google Play's servers generate optimized APKs that contain only the resources and code that are required by a particular device that is requesting installation of the app.

App components
App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app. Some components depend on others.
There are four different types of app components:

-Activities

 An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user.
 
-Services

A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. A service does not provide a user interface. For example, a service might play music in the background while the user is in a different app, or it might fetch data over the network without blocking user interaction with an activity. Another component, such as an activity, can start the service and let it run or bind to it in order to interact with it. There are actually two very distinct semantics services tell the system about how to manage an app: Started services tell the system to keep them running until their work is completed. This could be to sync some data in the background or play music even after the user leaves the app. Syncing data in the background or playing music also represent two different types of started services that modify how the system handles them:

  Music playback is something the user is directly aware of, so the app tells the system this by saying it wants to be foreground with a notification to tell the  user about it; in this case the system knows that it should try really hard to keep that service's process running, because the user will be unhappy if it goes away.

  A regular background service is not something the user is directly aware as running, so the system has more freedom in managing its process. It may allow it to be killed (and then restarting the service sometime later) if it needs RAM for things that are of more immediate concern to the user.

-Broadcast receivers

A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Because broadcast receivers are another well-defined entry into the app, the system can deliver broadcasts even to apps that aren't currently running. So, for example, an app can schedule an alarm to post a notification to tell the user about an upcoming event... and by delivering that alarm to a BroadcastReceiver of the app, there is no need for the app to remain running until the alarm goes off. Many broadcasts originate from the system—for example, a broadcast announcing that the screen has turned off, the battery is low, or a picture was captured. Apps can also initiate broadcasts—for example, to let other apps know that some data has been downloaded to the device and is available for them to use. Although broadcast receivers don't display a user interface, they may create a status bar notification to alert the user when a broadcast event occurs. More commonly, though, a broadcast receiver is just a gateway to other components and is intended to do a very minimal amount of work. For instance, it might schedule a JobService to perform some work based on the event with JobScheduler
A broadcast receiver is implemented as a subclass of BroadcastReceiver and each broadcast is delivered as an Intent object. For more information, see the BroadcastReceiver class.

-Content providers

A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access. Through the content provider, other apps can query or modify the data if the content provider allows it. For example, the Android system provides a content provider that manages the user's contact information. 

Activating components

Three of the four component types—activities, services, and broadcast receivers—are activated by an asynchronous message called an intent. Intents bind individual components to each other at runtime. You can think of them as the messengers that request an action from other components, whether the component belongs to your app or another.

Three of the four component types—activities, services, and broadcast receivers—are activated by an asynchronous message called an intent. Intents bind individual components to each other at runtime. You can think of them as the messengers that request an action from other components, whether the component belongs to your app or another.

An intent is created with an Intent object, which defines a message to activate either a specific component (explicit intent) or a specific type of component (implicit intent).

For activities and services, an intent defines the action to perform (for example, to view or send something) and may specify the URI of the data to act on, among other things that the component being started might need to know. For example, an intent might convey a request for an activity to show an image or to open a web page. In some cases, you can start an activity to receive a result, in which case the activity also returns the result in an Intent. For example, you can issue an intent to let the user pick a personal contact and have it returned to you. The return intent includes a URI pointing to the chosen contact.

For broadcast receivers, the intent simply defines the announcement being broadcast. For example, a broadcast to indicate the device battery is low includes only a known action string that indicates battery is low.

Unlike activities, services, and broadcast receivers, content providers are not activated by intents. Rather, they are activated when targeted by a request from a ContentResolver. The content resolver handles all direct transactions with the content provider so that the component that's performing transactions with the provider doesn't need to and instead calls methods on the ContentResolver object. This leaves a layer of abstraction between the content provider and the component requesting information (for security).

There are separate methods for activating each type of component:

You can start an activity or give it something new to do by passing an Intent to startActivity() or startActivityForResult() (when you want the activity to return a result).
With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later, you can use the JobScheduler class to schedule actions. For earlier Android versions, you can start a service (or give new instructions to an ongoing service) by passing an Intent to startService(). You can bind to the service by passing an Intent to bindService().
You can initiate a broadcast by passing an Intent to methods such as sendBroadcast(), sendOrderedBroadcast(), or sendStickyBroadcast().
You can perform a query to a content provider by calling query() on a ContentResolver.
For more information about using intents, see the Intents and Intent Filters document. The following documents provide more information about activating specific components: Activities, Services, BroadcastReceiver, and Content Providers.
